This is a fork of [merland/seedpicker](https://github.com/merland/seedpicker),
maintained with slightly different design goals.

SeedPicker generates the checksum word (24th word) for a Bitcoin seed phrase.
This method is designed for security, to be used offline, on an eternally quarantined machine.
That is, a machine with no Internet connection of any kind, running [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) from removable media.
